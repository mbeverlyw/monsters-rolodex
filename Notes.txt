Section 2:
    React Concepts

    The Birth of React
        jquery - Made the differences between browsers..
        As projects became more ambitious, the need for an efficient
            and simplified methodology was required.
        AngularJS was a SPA solution by Google.
            - Despite this, ambitious SPAs became harder to debug.
        ReactJS was created to further simplify this process.

    Declarative vs Imperative
        React handles DOM interactions
        DOM - manipulated via JS to manipulate a webpage.
        Imperative - Reactive relations between JS related changes
        Declarative - React uses states to make DOM editing more
            efficient.

    Component Architecture
        React allows developers to build and app like lego blocks.
        
    One Way Data Flow
        Unidirectional Data Flow
        VirtualDOM is created by JS
        State has to change so that SPA reflects a change.

    UI Library
        Basically, React has packages which will allow developers
            to develop apps for VR, Console, Desktop, Mobile, etc.

    How to be a Great React Developer
        1.) Decide on Components
        2.) Decide the State and where it lives
        3.) What changes when state changes.

    Environment Setup For Windows

    NPM vs YARN
        Install dependencies from package.json
            `npm install` == `yarn`
        Install a package and add to package.json
            `npm install <package> --save` == `yarn add <package>`
        Install a devDependency to package.json
            `npm install <package> --save-dev` == `yarn add <package> --dev`
        Remove dependency from package.json
            `npm uninstall <package> --save` == `yarn remove <package>`
        Upgrade a package to latest Version
            `npm update --save` == `yarn upgrade`
        Install a package globally
            `npm install package -g` == `yarn global add package`

    VSCode Settings
    
    Create React App 
        `npx create-react-app <project name>`

    React Project Setup
        Build project:
            `npm run build`, which creates the project>build dir.
        Babel 
            Packages JS files so they run across all browsers
        WebPack 
            Packages JS files and modules to create an optimized JS bundle.

    Don't Eject
        Not necessary - just expands create-react-app code which is already
            optimized.

    Class Components
        Why Classes? 
            A lot more capabilities compared to method.

    Thinking in JSX

    Dynamic Content

    map() + key attribute

    Single Page Application
        Lifecycle Methods:
            Methods that get called at different stages for components.

        API:

    Fetching Content

    Promises

    Architecting our App
    
    State vs Props
        State:
            Something that changes due to user interactions

        Props:
            Changes/information relating to the changed state.
